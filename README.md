## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of the project was to optimize Dana's webpage and dynamic table, in order to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. The optimization will allow users to filter for multiple criteria, including city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results

Users are able to filter data but inputting a criteria into the filter fields, and the webpage will then automatically filter the table to display the relevant data.
